# Odin-Recipes-Project

This is my first website project. I am following The Odin Project to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of web development. This is a recipe website with a main index page which includes links to a few recipes. It was developed using VS Code with basic HTML language and a little CSS. This Project also includes Prettier-Code formatter created by prettier.io. This formatter extension helped me format my code by enforcing a consistent style, parsing my code, and reprinting it with it`s own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. I plan to expand on this project as my knowledge expands through this course. Future Projects to come!
