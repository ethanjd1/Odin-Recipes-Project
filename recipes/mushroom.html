      <h3>Description</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          Delicious stuffed mushrooms with cream cheese — an appetizer with a
          kick. Always a party favorite when we make them. I usually double the
          recipe.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ul>
          <li>cooking spray</li>
          <li>12 whole fresh mushrooms, tough ends trimmed</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
          <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
          <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a baking
            sheet with cooking spray.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clean mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Carefully break stems from
            mushrooms. Finely chop stems and set caps aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry chopped mushroom
            stems and garlic in hot oil until any moisture has disappeared,
            taking care not to burn the garlic, 3 to 5 minutes. Spread mushroom
            mixture into a bowl to cool completely, about 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, onion powder, and
            cayenne pepper into the cooled mushroom mixture until very thick and
            completely mixed. Use a small spoon to fill each mushroom cap with a
            generous amount of stuffing. Arrange stuffed mushrooms on the
            prepared cookie sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until piping hot and liquid starts to
            form under each cap, about 20 minutes.
          </li>
        </ol>
