      <h3>Description</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          This beefy mushroom Swiss burger recipe is too good not to try! It's a
          great way to spice up an ordinary hamburger. Not only can this be done
          on the grill, but you can also pan-fry the burgers if preferred.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ul>
          <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon seasoned meat tenderizer</li>
          <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
          <li>2 (4 ounce) cans sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
          <li>4 slices Swiss cheese</li>
          <li>6 hamburger buns</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <div class="section">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Divide ground beef into 6 equal-sized patties; season with meat
            tenderizer, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and soy
            sauce; cook and stir until browned. Set aside and keep warm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grill patties on the preheated grill until cooked through, about 6
            minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
            center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Spoon mushroom mixture evenly on top of patties on the grill; top
            each one with a slice of Swiss cheese. Cover the grill until cheese
            melts, about 1 minute. Remove patties from the grill and serve on
            hamburger buns.
          </li>
        </ol>
